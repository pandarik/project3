## Project purpose
The Vacation rental property finder/comparison tool aims to assist users in finding, comparing, and suggesting rental properties for their stays based on destination, price, ratings, and amenities. Whether planning a getaway or relocating, users can explore available properties, filter based on preferences, and visualize essential information.
With an emphasis on the data visualization track.

## How to setup and run the Flask powered API backend and HTML Javascript frontend Visualization:  
Data Setup:  
 - PostgreSQL Database is created in pgAdmin, with the database being named "Project_3".
 - A table named "Vacation_Rental_DT" is used to hold data that was generated from web-scraping. This table is created using the SQL script found in file "SQL Table Create.sql".  Afterwhich this table is populated by importing the scrapped data found in file "Data\vacation_rental.csv".
 - A table named "property" is used by the Flask application, and it requires additional SQL setup.  The SQL script used to transform the "Vacation_Rental_DT" table into the final "Properties_DT" table is found within section 1. of the file "flask_api_server_and_web_visualization\Flask_App_Setup_Notes.txt".  Run this block of SQL script to generate and populate an intermediate "cleaned_properties" table, and then the final "property" table.  

Python Environment Setup:  
 - The python runtime environment used to run the Flask application must have the following 3 python modules loaded:  
    1.) flask,  2.) flask-sqlalchemy,  3.) psycopg2  
    ( psycopg2 is used "under the hood" by sqlalchemy to connect to the PostgreSQL database )

Run the Flask App  
 - The Flask API web server backend is started using the following command ...  
 python flask_application.py  

Enjoy the Visualization  
 - Navigate a web-browser to the URL generated by the Flask startup proceedure ... which is typically ...  
 "http://127.0.0.1:5000"

## Ethical considerations made in the project
In our project focused on vacation rental properties in Southwest Florida, we have made significant efforts to ensure ethical considerations are thoroughly addressed. We have prioritized data privacy by anonymizing any personal information collected during our data scraping process from platforms like Airbnb and VRBO. Also, we have followed the terms of service of these websites to avoid any unauthorized data extraction. Our data analysis and visualization practices are designed to be transparent and unbiased, ensuring that the insights generated are accurate and fair. We have also taken steps to ensure that our findings do not inadvertently harm property owners or renters by avoiding any misrepresentation of data. Overall, our commitment to ethical standards has been a guiding principle throughout the project, ensuring that our work is both responsible and respectful of all stakeholders involved.

Additionally, when we were looking at the data, we made sure that we didn't get any proprietary information and if we were we would need to take into consideration on what items we would need to show or state where we gathered the data from. Such as including an image of their logo in our presentation. We also wanted to look at certain dates to see what rental locations were available so we aren’t gathering data that wouldn’t be used in our project or for potential future works. Also, we narrowed down our location areas so we can get a more defined dataset for our needs and not slow down our systems by having large datasets.

## References for any code used that is not your own
A boilerplate starting point, to auto-load and render an HTML Javascript template from a Flask "/" root endpoint, and to call a PosgreSQL query from within a Flask data request endpoint, came from a ChatGPT v3.5 conversation.  This starting code was then modified on our part to fit our purpose.
