When we were looking at the data, we made sure that we didn't get any proprietary information and if we were we would need to take into consideration on what items we would need to show or state where we gathered the data from. Such as including an image of their logo in our presentation. We also wanted to look at certain dates to see what rental locations were available so we aren’t gathering data that wouldn’t be used in our project or for potential future works. Also we narrowed down our location areas so we can get a more defined dataset for our needs and not slow down our systems by having large datasets.
